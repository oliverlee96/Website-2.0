    <p>
      I'm a passionate Product Manager who has been exploring Software Engineering for a few years now. My journey in tech started at Elements.cloud, a SaaS company, where I've been bridging the gap between product management and software engineering. I've been elbow-deep in everything from enhancing our  product's UI/UX to leading the project for building our first OpenAPI and Webhook infrastructure.

      My journey into tech hasn't been conventional, and in 2015 I graduated in Sociology from the University of Bristol. This gives me a unique angle and a fresh perspective when it comes to understanding user needs in the tech world.

      Outside of work, I'm all about seeking new challenges and expanding my horizons. From bagging the AWS Cloud Certified Practitioner certification to chipping away at a 100-day web development course on Udemy, I'm always keen on leveling up my skills and staying in sync with the latest in tech. Swing by my 'Portfolio' section to get the full rundown!
